   <p> Hey, you! since you have already come this far, im assuming you love poetry as much as i do. <br>
This has not always been the case for me, though. When i was much younger, I loved to write. <br>
 As i got older, the fire may have died down a bit. <br>
  One fine day during an English lesson, i realised that writing really is on outlet for me, considering how much i hate talking about how i feel. <br>
   Why should i keep bottling up my emotions while i have a pen and paper?<br>
    Also, i had been begging God to show me what my talent is. <br>
     I gave my life to Christ <em>( BEST CHOICE EVER!)</em> and ive had a much easier time expressing myself generally. <br>
      All this inspired me to help other people who may want to write or express themselves, especially if they struggle to do that verbally. <br>
       I  understand fully how it feels to feel "alone" or "lonely" and suffering in silence is no fun for sure. <br>
        Anyway, sixteen right now and in the process of discovering myself, and i would love to help those who want to do the same. <br>
         That drove me to start this whole page and help others as well <br> </p>
